COMMANDS
  thread create "<title>" "<content>"
                                     Opens a thread with content as its first message and prints its id;
                                     content may be - for stdin or --file <path>, capped at 2000 characters
  thread post <thread-id> "<content>"
                                     Adds a message; !>>tab-id<<! in content mentions a tab by id or by
                                     a unique prefix of at least 8 characters
  thread read <thread-id> [--all] [--before <message-id>] [--limit N]
                                     Reads a thread newest first, 10 messages a page; a lemongrass
                                     tab sees only what it has not read unless --all is given
  thread list [--limit N]           Threads in this project, most recently active first

  workgroup create <path-to-config>
                                     Declares a workgroup from a YAML or JSON config and asks the human to approve it in the
                                     lemongrass app; approved thinkers open as tabs next to this one, and this tab is the leader
  workgroup disband <id>            Ends a workgroup; only its leader may. Tabs stay open and the thread stays readable
  workgroup thread [--all] [--before <message-id>] [--limit N]
                                     Reads this tab's workgroup thread, post to it with thread post
  workgroup list [--json]           Live workgroups in this project with their members and tab ids; needs no tab

  listen [--timeout 10m] [--block] Blocks until a thread notification for this tab is pending, then prints it and
                                     exits; meant to run backgrounded so its exit wakes an idle model, relaunch on return.
                                     A Claude tab is notified directly, so it only records itself as ready unless --block

  tips add "<message>"              Add a project-local custom tip, surfaced alongside the
                                     built-in ones on the periodic PostToolUse nudge
  tips list                         List this project's custom tips, with their ids
  tips remove <id>                  Remove a custom tip by id

  sign [--session-id <id>] <checklist-id>
                                     Satisfies a .lgrass/checklists.json prerequisite gate for the
                                     current session, until that checklist's TTL expires

  session list                      Other live sessions in this project, with active/idling state, tab id and vendor
  session tabs list                 Tab id to session id map for this project, as JSON

  db <short-id> --sql "<statement>" [--dry-run|--commit]
                                     Model-facing: runs a statement against the database a channel
                                     grants access to, through the running agent and vault daemons.
                                     A read (SELECT/SHOW/DESCRIBE/EXPLAIN) runs immediately; a write
                                     (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) requires exactly one of --dry-run
                                     (rolled back, reports the row count) or --commit (persists)

  rester <short-id> info            Model-facing: prints a channel's base URL, expiry, allowed
                                     methods and users
  rester <short-id> users           Model-facing: prints a channel's users with their tags
  rester <short-id> <get|post|put|patch|delete|head|options> <path> [--user <name>] [--body '<json>']
                                     Model-facing: proxies one HTTP call through the channel's
                                     domain as user, through the running agent and vault daemons

  version                           Print version
